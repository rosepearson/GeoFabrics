.. py:class:: BaseProcessor(json_instructions)

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   An abstract class with general methods for accessing elements in
   instruction files including populating default values. Also contains
   functions for downloading remote data using geopais, and constructing data
   file lists.

   .. py:method:: create_metadata()

      A clase to create metadata to be added as netCDF attributes.


   .. py:method:: get_instruction_path(key)

      Return the file path from the instruction file, or default if there
      is a default value and the local cache is specified. Raise an error if
      the key is not in the instructions.


   .. py:method:: check_instruction_path(key)

      Return True if the file path exists in the instruction file, or True
      if there is a default value and the local cache is specified.


   .. py:method:: create_results_folder()

      Ensure the results folder has been created.


   .. py:method:: get_resolution()

      Return the resolution from the instruction file. Raise an error if
      not in the instructions.


   .. py:method:: get_crs()

      Return the CRS projection information (horiztonal and vertical) from
      the instruction file. Raise an error if 'output' is not in the instructions. If
      no 'crs' or 'horizontal' or 'vertical' values are specified then use the default
      value for each one missing from the instructions. If the default is used it is
      added to the instructions.


   .. py:method:: get_instruction_general(key)

      Return the general instruction from the instruction file or return
      the default value if not specified in the instruction file. Raise an
      error if the key is not in the instructions and there is no default
      value. If the default is used it is added to the instructions.


   .. py:method:: get_processing_instructions(key)

      Return the processing instruction from the instruction file or
      return the default value if not specified in the instruction file. If
      the default is used it is added to the instructions.

      :param key: The string identifying the instruction


   .. py:method:: check_apis(key, api_type)

      Check to see if APIs are included in the instructions and if the key is
      included in specified apis

      :param key: The string identifying the vector/raster
      :param api_type: The string identifying if the key is a vector or raster


   .. py:method:: check_vector_or_raster(key, api_type)

      Check to see if vector or raster key (i.e. land, bathymetry_contours, etc) is
      included either as a file path, or within any of API's (i.e. LINZ or LRIS).

      :param key: The string identifying the vector/raster
      :param api_type: The string identifying if the key is a vector or raster


   .. py:method:: get_vector_or_raster_paths(key, api_type)

      Get the path to the vector/raster key data included either as a file path or
      as an API. Return all paths where the vector key is specified. In the case that
      an API is specified ensure the data is fetched as well.

      :param key: The string identifying the vector/raster
      :param api_type: The string identifying if the key is a vector or raster


   .. py:method:: get_lidar_dataset_crs(data_service, dataset_name)

      Checks to see if source CRS of an associated LiDAR datasets has be specified
      in the instruction file. If it has been specified, this CRS is returned, and
      will later be used to override the CRS encoded in the LAS files.


   .. py:method:: get_lidar_file_list()

      Return a dictionary with three enties 'file_paths', 'crs' and
      'tile_index_file'. The 'file_paths' contains a list of LiDAR tiles to process.

      The 'crs' (or coordinate system of the LiDAR data as defined by an EPSG code) is
      only optionally set (if unset the value is None). The 'crs' should only be set
      if the CRS information is not correctly encoded in the LAZ/LAS files. Currently
      this is only supported for OpenTopography LiDAR.

      The 'tile_index_file' is also optional (if unset the value is None). The
      'tile_index_file' should be given if a tile index file exists for the LiDAR
      files specifying the extents of each tile. This is currently only supported for
      OpenTopography files.

      If a LiDAR API is specified this is checked and all files within the catchment
      area are downloaded and used to construct the file list. If none is specified,
      the instruction 'data_paths' is checked for 'lidars' and these are returned.


   .. py:method:: run()
      :abstractmethod:

      This method controls the processor execution and code-flow.



.. py:class:: RawLidarDemGenerator(json_instructions)

   an instruction file.
